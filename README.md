## The Intoduction
Kauri Point Construction is a company based in Auckland that provides construction services big and small such as new builds, renovation, cabinetry, fencing and landscaping. It is a limited company established in February 2021. This project included planning, building, and testing a project management app. Kauri Point Construction also had no website for their customers, thus customer landing pages were also in scope.  

## Requirements

### STATEMENT OF PROBLEM OR NEED
The problem is Kauri Point Construction does not have a project management system everything is currently done manually across many separate files. For instance, project scheduling is communicated verbally by the project manager if the plan changes this can result in confusion, rework and a dissatisfied customer.
A successful solution would be introducing a digital solution that includes process automation and tracking. The web-based project management system includes the business processes for project management, workforce scheduling and optimisation, accounting management, with all the steps in one centralised place, therefore the project information is always accurate and current. Moreover, the company focus on sustainability contributes to society and the community. The solution reduces paper-based documentation saving valuable resources and decreasing emissions by removing unnecessary travel due to scheduling errors.

### List of business requirements
List of business processes
-	Provide a web interface for the potential client; this is including the contact page to send a request for a consultation. Store the client details and send a notification to the manager.
-	The manager or staff go to the site and consult with the potential client for first meeting to confirm all the requirements and collect required measurements etc to prepare a quote.
-	Create a quote, a job description and a contract document within the system and send it out to the client for approval. Storing the information in the database.
-	Once the client signs the contract, the quote becomes the project schedule/agenda, and the start date for the project is scheduled.
-	Manager organises the supplies, and resources for the job. (Supplies summed from tasks)
-	Order material and receives invoices for them, to enable payment of expenses.
-	The staff go to the site and follow the schedule. Creating a mandatory daily update with a simple report and photo via the application. If any issue occurs, then they must report it to the manager via the application.
-	Tasks can be added to the schedule if work outside of the original scope is required.
-	Variations Orders to the contract scope can be tracked, adding and removing all tasks involved to the Project Schedule.
-	When the tasks have been completed, the manager inspects all the work and confirms the completion of the job on the web app.
-	Completed tasks can be collated into a report and sent to the client as an invoice.
-	Once the payment is confirmed, the process has been completed.

### SCOPE
Our scope was to build the project management app for the manager which records each projects details, tasks and estimate cost list, and labour list which shows estimate days per task by labour. Customer landing pages were also included in the first release. The workforce management system is in the backlog, as currently they use an existing online service for staff to clock in and clock out. Accounting system including payroll is out of scope. It will be included in the next release, or it might integrate to COTs such as Xero or MYOB. Depending on the financial situation of the construction company, however the COTs option would be my recommendation to simplify bank reconciliation and accuracy, avoiding legal issues.


## Development

### Technologies
- React v17.0.2
- HTML 5
- CSS 3
- JavaScript
- Firebase v8.5

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
