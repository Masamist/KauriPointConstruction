## The Intoduction

Kauri Point Construction is a company based in Auckland that provides construction services big and small such as new builds, renovation, cabinetry, fencing and landscaping. It is a limited company established in February 2021. The manager has award-winning building and management skills including project management and communication, the company consistently receives high customer ratings.

## STATEMENT OF PROBLEM OR NEED
The problem is Kauri Point Construction does not have a project management system everything is currently done manually across many separate files. For instance, project scheduling is communicated verbally by the project manager if the plan changes this can result in confusion, rework and a dissatisfied customer. 
A successful solution would be introducing a digital solution that includes process automation and tracking. The web-based project management assists the business processes of projects, workforce scheduling and optimisation, accounting management, with all the steps in one centralised place, therefore the project information is always current and accurate. Moreover, the company has a focus on sustainability to contribute to society and the community. The solution will reduce paper-based documentation saving valuable resources and decrease emissions by removing unnecessary travel due to scheduling errors.

## USER STORIES

Write user stories for the business processes including supporting business processes (e.g., data set up, configuration)
Client: I want to be able to be out of town for a week and still see how the project is progressing daily.
Manager: I dream of pricing up a job using a library of Tasks I've already executed on projects and re-use data to speed up the process.
Manager: I want to record all project details in one place which can be shared with authorised users, so I don’t need to update disparate documents separately.
Staff: I like to know that I’ve completed tasks and what’s expected on site for the day.
Staff: It would be great to see a previous photo that my workmate took last week, he’s unavailable today.

### BACKLOG

List explicitly what is not included in the first iterations
In the first release of this software, accounting system intergration including payroll is out of scope. It will be included in the next release, or it might integrate to COTs such as Xero or MYOB. Depends on the financial situation of the construction company, however, COTs option may simplify bank reconciliation and accuracy, avoiding legal issues.
