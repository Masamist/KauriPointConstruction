# Kauri Point Construction Web Project

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## The Intoduction

Kauri Point Construction is a company based in Auckland that provides construction services big and small such as new builds, renovation, cabinetry, fencing and landscaping. It is a limited company established in February 2021. The manager has award-winning building and management skills including project management and communication, the company consistently receives high customer ratings.

## STATEMENT OF PROBLEM OR NEED
The problem is Kauri Point Construction does not have a management system everything is currently done manually across many separate files. For instance, project scheduling is communicated verbally by the project manager if the plan changes this can result in confusion, rework and a dissatisfied customer. 
A successful solution would be introducing digital solution that includes process automation and tracking. The web-based project management assists the business processes of projects, workforce scheduling and optimisation, accounting management, with all steps in one centralised place, therefore the project information is always updated. Moreover, the company focus on sustainability to contribute to society and community. The solution will reduce paper-based documentation saving valuable resources and decrease emissions by removing unnecessary travel due to scheduling errors.


### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
